# General information:

> The website is divided into 4 sections:
**(Header - Left sidebar - Body - Right sidebar)** on all pages.

> The **left sidebar** is always the navigation menu.

> The **Right sidebar** on the other hand will look different depending on what page we are on. It can act like a filter menu or blocks container or other things. 
The Sidebars are always collapsed by default and will expand upon mouse hover.

> I really dont want to rely on any external third party dependencies or repositories to solve things. Everything **MUST** be internal

> The Falcon dashboard template **MUST** be used. 

> illustrations made by me and uploaded to Google Drive is the final look of the website. Please check often and work toward it.</sub>
