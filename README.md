# General information 
> Each page is divided into 4 sections: **Header - Left sidebar - Body - Right sidebar**

> The **left sidebar** is always the Navigation menu.

> The **Right sidebar** on the other hand changes depending on what page you are on. It can act like a filter menu on one page and a menu on another.

> The Sidebars are always collapsed by default and will expand upon mouse hover, and collapse again when out of focus.

> I don't want to rely on any external third-party dependencies or repositories to solve things. Everything **MUST** be internal.

> The Falcon dashboard template provided **MUST** be used. No workaround. Template files in [FrontShare/Falcon Dashboard Template Files](https://github.com/Zatacka/FrontShare/tree/main/Falcon%20Dashboard%20Template%20Files)
