General information
__________________________________________________________________________________
The website is divided into 4 sections:
(Header
Left sidebar - Body - Right sidebar)
The left sidebar is always the navigation menu.
The Right sidebar on the other hand is different depending on what page we are on. 
It can act like a filter menu or a block menu or other things. 
The Sidebars are always collapsed by default and will expand upon mouse hover.
__________________________________________________________________________________
I really dont want to rely on any external third party dependencies or repositories to solve things. Everything MUST be internal
The Falcon dashboard template MUST be used. 
__________________________________________________________________________________
illustrations made by me and uploaded to Google Drive is the final look of the website. Please check often and work toward it.

Profile Page:
Canvas(Submenu): Users can edit their own front pages by dragging and dropping blocks into their canvas to be saved and displayed on a preview page that can be shared with a link or a QR code.
You select a block from the Drag & Drop window to the right of the page for example Text block and it will be highlighted. You click the right arrow.
You will be presented with a couple of variations for that text block. You select a fitting variation and drag it to the canvas to the left and drop it. You click the right arrow.
You will be presented with Properties that will be different depending on what block and variation you have selected because not all content can be fitted into all variations. You fill everything out like font size, font family, font color...etc. You click the right arrow.
Now you can select the shapes of the block if you want it outlined, filled, with a shadow or inner glow. Also, how rounded the edges will be. You click the right arrow.
Now you can select colors for the block background, it can either be a solid color, gradient, or animated. (The animated ones and for VIP members). You click the right arrow.
Now you select the behavior of the block. Like the animation when the website load or on mouse hover. You click the arrow right.
Now you can select a background for the main background (not the blocks) that can also be solid, gradient, or animated. (The animated ones and for VIP members). Now you can either click save on canvas or keep doing this process with more of the same or different blocks. 
Blocks can either be on top of each other or side by side.
Payments(Submenu): Where the user fills in their payment method and selects a Plan. Example: https://prium.github.io/falcon/v3.14.0/app/e-commerce/billing.html

E-Commerce Page:

Costumers(Submenu):

Referral page:
The website offers rewards for those that invite more people to the website. But they only receive payment when the newcomer actually uses the paid features to prevent auto account generators and spammers to fill the database with trash. Example: https://prium.github.io/falcon/v3.14.0/pages/miscellaneous/invite-people.html

Resources page:
Tutorials(Submenu): videos to show how the website operates and how to improve the experience
Workshop(Submenu): Where users can share their own backgrounds and animations they have uploaded with everyone else to use(require a VIP subscription to use them).

Analytics page:
Every user can see how much traffic they are getting to their page and how much they have earned from displaying ads, selling products, and tippings. Example: https://prium.github.io/falcon/v3.14.0/dashboard/e-commerce.html

Calendar page:
Here the user can view their schedule and book appointments for their businesses. the drag function is included here to move blocks around. Example: https://prium.github.io/falcon/v3.14.0/app/calendar.html

Help page:
The user will input what he/she needs help with. a robot will present a few answers from the FAQs page related to the issue. if the user does not get his question answered he will get an option to contact support by creating a ticket where he/she will be assigned a Supporter.
FAQ(Submenu): where the most asked question will be answered so they don't have to bother the support desk unless the answer isn't helpful. example: https://prium.github.io/falcon/v3.14.0/pages/faq/faq-basic.html

Job application(Submenu): Here is where a user can apply to work for FrontShare as a Support employee.

Support Desk(Require Employee access):
Reports(Submenu): This shows how well the support desk is doing. Example https://prium.github.io/falcon/v3.14.0/dashboard/support-desk.html

Tickets(Submenu): a list of all the active tickets. On each, it shows the name, subject, status, priority, and assigned agent. Can be entered and interacted with. Support employees only have access to information about the user they are helping, not all users and after the issue is solved they will not have access to anything. Example: https://prium.github.io/falcon/v3.14.0/app/support-desk/table-view.html
but using the right sidebar as I implemented it of course.

Chat(Submenu): Where the team can communicate with each other if they need help solving anything. Example: https://prium.github.io/falcon/v3.14.0/app/chat.html


Admin(Require Admin Access):
Dashboard: where the website owner can view the well-being of the website.
Database: Where the admin can access all forms of information about the users and employees. That is also where the Admin assigns someone employee access.
Applications: Here is where admin can review job applications submitted by users.
